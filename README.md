# 🧬 Cancer Classification from RNA-Seq Gene Expression 

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on classifying different types of cancer using gene expression (RNA-Seq) data.
Machine learning models are trained on high-dimensional biological data to identify patterns that distinguish cancer types.

## 📊 Results

| Model          | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|---------------|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| Random Forest | 0.9963   | 0.9964   | 0.9963 | 0.9963   |
| SVM           | 0.9988   | 0.9988   | 0.9988 | 0.9988   |

- Strong performance across all cancer types  
- Minimal misclassification  
- Validated using 5-fold cross-validation
