# 🧬 Cancer Classification from RNA-Seq Gene Expression 

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on classifying different types of cancer using gene expression (RNA-Seq) data.
Machine learning models are trained on high-dimensional biological data to identify patterns that distinguish cancer types.

## 📊 Results

| Model         | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
| ------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| Random Forest | ~0.99    | ~0.99     | ~0.99  | ~0.99    |
| SVM           | ~0.99    | ~0.99     | ~0.99  | ~0.99    |

* Strong performance across all classes
* Minimal misclassification
