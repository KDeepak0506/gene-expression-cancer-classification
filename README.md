## 📌 Overview

This project explores how machine learning can classify different cancer types 
using high-dimensional RNA-Seq gene expression data (~20,000 features per sample).

The focus is on understanding how **feature selection** and **dimensionality reduction**
impact performance in complex biological datasets.

> 🚀 Achieved **~99.88% accuracy** using classical ML models on ~20,000-dimensional biological data.

## 🔍 Interpretation

- High accuracy even after feature reduction → strong signal concentration in a subset of genes  
- PCA reveals clearly separable clusters → highly structured data  
- Feature selection reduces ~20,000 features significantly without performance loss  
- Models generalize well across all cancer types  
- Class imbalance has negligible impact  

> 💡 **Key Insight:** Only a small subset of genes is required for accurate cancer classification,  
making feature selection a critical step in high-dimensional biological data.
